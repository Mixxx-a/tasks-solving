<p>Given 2 arrays of numbers, return intersections of elements (that are present in both arrays), considering the repetition of elements.
Order of elements in resulting array is not important.</p>
<p>Example1:
<br>array1: [1, 2, 3, 2, 0]
<br>array2: [5, 1, 2, 7, 3]
<br>result: [1, 2, 3]
</p>
<p>Example2:
<br>array1: [1, 2, 3, 2, 0]
<br>array2: [5, 1, 2, 7, 3, 2]
<br>result: [1, 2, 2, 3]
